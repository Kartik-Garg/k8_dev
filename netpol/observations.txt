Thought process:
To check if the label of a pod is modified, we can use informer?
and we will have to compare it to the label mentioned in the netpol
so we will need the informer or something else to keep track of the netpol as well

approach: 
used a clientset to get the network policy and store all the lables of allowed pods
we can use that in informers to watch the pods, watch only the pods which match that label, if edited (udpated), we can trigger a warning
